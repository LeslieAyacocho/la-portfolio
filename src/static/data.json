        "about": "The Asia Pacific Research Association on Curriculum Studies, Inc. (APRACSI) started as an initiative of a group of enthusiastic Curriculum Studies students, with help of their area adviser, in the University of the Philippines, Diliman, Quezon City early in 2017. The Asia Pacific Conference on Curriculum Studies and Instructional Designing (APCCSID) was the first focus of this group of people during that formative period, but seeing the need to establish a professional organization to anchor the future long term goals of the conference, the APRACSI was soon formed.",
